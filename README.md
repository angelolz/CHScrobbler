# CHScrobbler
CHScrobbler is a simple Java app that reads the exported currently playing song text file from Clone Hero and uses that information for scrobbling to last.fm.

This app was created by a request of a friend who is a big user of last.fm. I decided to put this out in public for those that may be interested in scrobbling their songs in Clone Hero.

## Installation/Usage
0. Before starting the app, please make sure that **"Export Current Song"** is enabled in your Clone Hero Settings.
1. Download the latest version of **CHScrobbler**.
2. Place the `.exe`/`.jar` file inside your own **Clone Hero directory**.
3. You may open the program. Upon opening the program, it will prompt you to provide your last.fm credentials so that it may be able to scrobble under your name.  

    ***Note***: If you don't want to do the setup, create a file called `config.txt` in the same directory as the .exe and put these properties in it and fill it in: 
```
lastfm_apikey=
lastfm_secret=
lastfm_username=
lastfm_password=
scrobble_threshold_seconds=30
```

You can get your last.fm api details [here](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create).

4. After getting the app set up, you can play a song. After playing the song for 30 seconds (or whatever `scrobble_threshold_seconds` is set to), the app provides a log of the song you're currently playing and lets you know if a song was successfully scrobbled.
